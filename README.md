# CallAwsLambda
Use REST API and Google Remote Procedure Call to call AWS Lambda function

I continously got the error saying 
### GreeterGrpc is already defined as object GreeterGrpc object GreeterGrpc {
Using the direcotry structure attached helps overcome that, but then the GRPC doesn't work.
While, running the same code on a friend's system worked.
In case anyone figures out the issue, please let me know.
